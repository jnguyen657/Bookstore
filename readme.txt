Bookstore Project

Webpage designed with HTML/CSS that is connected to a MySQL server (hosted on PHPMyAdmin).
Users first create an account from the home page, which is uploaded to the SQL database,
and can start placing, updating, and viewing their orders, which are also uploaded to the database.
PHP is used to query the MySQL data and echo data onto the HTML page.
